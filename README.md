# Notes app üìù

Mobile application written using React Native and Typescript using an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project.

## About

The application contains three pages: home page, note page and comment page. The home page displays a login button which authenticates the user through Auth0 Open ID connect (OIDC)configurations.

Once the user is successfully authenticated, an id_token is stored securely using SecureStore from expo-secure-store for native platforms or local storage for the web. This token is then used in the authorization for every API endpoint.

The application allows users to view, create and delete their notes and its associated comments using the API specified.

## Get started

   ```bash
   npm install

2. Start the app

    npx expo start
